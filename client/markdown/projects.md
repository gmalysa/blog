## Current Projects
* Hardware/software design for an "electronic board game" system using capacitive touch, near-field
  communications, and a custom designed PCB with [demo video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tij-bQB88B0)
* Developer and Admin for the [Learn Dota 2 League](http://ld2l.gg)

## Past Projects

### Research
* [Hidden Markov Model-based Gesture Recognition with FMCW Radar](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7905995),
  an experiment in using automotive FMCW radar to detect and categorize coarse hand gestures based on
  micro-Doppler measurements
* [qvz](https://github.com/mikelhernaez/qvz), a high performance lossy compression algorithm for
  quality scores in genomic data ([Bioinformatics
  paper](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/05/28/bioinformatics.btv330.abstract))
* Work with [Professor Arbabian](http://www.stanford.edu/~arbabian/Home/Welcome.html) in the DC-THz
  lab at Stanford University, studying mm-Wave radar and applications:
	* Short range imaging at 60 GHz
	* Simulation and numerical analysis
	* Frequency estimation and super-resolution

### Programming
* Node.js packages (not actively maintained due to time constraints)
	* [db-filters](https://github.com/gmalysa/db-filters) - A database-based “filtering” engine,
	  originally used to generate WHERE clauses for SQL from complex datatypes automatically, this
	  now has expanded to include lots of database abstraction. Originally this was a set of PHP
	  classes I used extensively for private development, but now I’m developing an open source
	  version in Node.js.
	* [flux-link](https://github.com/gmalysa/flux-link) - A control flow management library that
	  helps simplify the creation of callback-heavy code, with support for exception handling,
	  argument passing, and shared local state for each running instance of an execution chain.
	* [math-captcha](https://github.com/gmalysa/math-captcha) - A Node.js library that uses LaTeX
	  and dvipng to create simple CAPTCHA images that ask the user to solve a math problem. Can be
	  extended with custom operators and includes options to specify the complexity of the questions
	  being generated.
	* [well-rng](https://github.com/gmalysa/well-rng) - An implementation of WELL-1024a that aims to
	  be very fast, lightweight, and limited in scope. Allows precise state manipulation and works
	  on the browser through browserify.
	* [spyglass](https://npmjs.org/package/spyglass) - An object inspection class for Node.js
	  developed as a fork/replacement for the original eyes.js library, with extra features and a
	  high degree of customization.
* [LISP-like interpreter](https://github.com/gmalysa/cs-lisp) - A basic implementation of a
  LISP-like interpreter based on the original McCarthy paper. The goal is just to explore the
  implementation of the pieces of an interpreter or compiler and understand more about how
  programming languages work.
* Lead Developer and Sysadmin for the [Star Wars Combine](http://www.swcombine.com)

### Undergrad Stuff
* [Acoustic Air Modem](https://github.com/gmalysa/ece4760-acoustic-modem) - Project for [ECE
  476](http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/) at Cornell University  
	[Report](http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/s2010/gjm76_asr96/gjm76_asr96/index.html)
	\- [Video](http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/s2010/gjm76_asr96/AcousticModem.MP4)
* [CUAUV](http://www.cuauv.org/) - Undergraduate project team for the annual AUVSI autonomous
  underwater vehicle competition (now called RoboSub). I worked on the Hydrophones system and
  developed the system used in competition from 2010 through at least 2013, running on an ADSP2139.
