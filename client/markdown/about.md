## About

I am an electrical engineer whose interests include computer architecture, analog circuit design,
digital signal processing, and programming in a wide variety of languages. I do a lot of hands-on
implementation work, such as doing PCB layout, assembling prototypes, and writing software for both
embedded and general purpose systems. I also enjoy research and do many academic or proof-of-concept
projects just to see if something can be done. If it involves electricity, I probably think it is
interesting.

I am currently working for Texas Instruments. In the past, I was a post-quals PhD student at
Stanford University. My posts here are my own and do not represent TI in any way, and in general I
do not write about things related to my jobâ€™s activities.

This blog is made using a combination of technologies:
* Node.js for server-side javascript
* LaTeX and related utilities (dvipng, etc.) for math
* Prism.js for syntax highlighting
* Markdown, rendered with showdownjs, for post formatting
