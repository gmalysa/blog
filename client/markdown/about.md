## About

I am an electrical engineer whose interests include computer architecture,
analog circuit design, digital signal processing, and programming in a wide
variety of languages. I do a lot of hands-on implementation work, such as doing
PCB layout, assembling prototypes, and writing software for both embedded and
general purpose systems. I also enjoy research and do many academic or
proof-of-concept projects just to see if something can be done. If it involves
electricity, I probably think it is interesting.

I am currently working for Timesys Corporation as a Principal Engineer, often
involved in security (OP-TEE, Secure Boot), driver development, or a weirdly
large amount of networking stuff (like modifying switch drivers and writing eBPF
programs + extensions to accomplish customer-directed goals). Most recently
I've been part of a team developing the Analog Devices SC5xx BSP, including
TEE, U-Boot, and Linux support. In the past, I worked on Radar and Lidar
signal processing at TI as part of the Perception and Analytics Lab, where we
developed the first version of the [PercepTIon
Toolkit](https://software-dl.ti.com/jacinto7/esd/processor-sdk-rtos-jacinto7/08_00_00_12/exports/docs/perception/ptk_release_notes.html)
, although it has been substantially improved since the time I was last
involved! Before that I was a PhD student at Stanford University where I
studied radar signal processing before leaving to join TI. My posts here are my
own and do not represent current or past employers in any way, and in general I
do not write about things related to my job activities.
