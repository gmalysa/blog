## Contact Me

Please feel free to contact me with questions, comments, suggestions, or any
other type of feedback. I am generally not available for consulting work at
this time, but if youâ€™ve got a question or would like to learn about something
related to what I've written about or computer science, electrical engineering,
or computer engineering topics in general, please feel free to send me your
question and hopefully I can answer it with a post providing an in-depth
explanation.

I can be reached only by email or on LinkedIn as I don't maintain any other
active, public social media accounts. My email address is
gmalysa-at-alumni-dot-stanford-dot-edu (if this is confusing, see [my github
profile](https://github.com/gmalysa) for a link).
