## Contact Me

Please feel free to contact me with questions, comments, suggestions, or any other type of feedback.
I am also available for consulting work related to the topics discussed on my blog, as well as
general work involving programming in several languages (C, C++, PHP, and Node.js, others are
negotiable).

In particular, if youâ€™ve got a question or would like to learn about something related to what I
write about or computer science, electrical engineering, or computer engineering in general, please
feel free to submit your question and hopefully I can answer it with a post providing an in-depth
explanation.

I can be reached in these ways:
* On twitter, as [@ButteryGreg](https://twitter.com/ButteryGreg)
* On discord, as ButteryGreg#2112
* Via email, as gmalysa-at-alumni-dot-stanford-dot-edu (if this is confusing, see [my github
  profile](https://github.com/gmalysa) for a link)
